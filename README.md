# Berry Project 
The goal of this GitHub repo is to organize, save and display berry data collected all across Inuit Nunagut by creating survey forms for the different species. The submissions from these surveys will be geolocated and appear in the main map as abundance charts. Using MapBox as a display tool introduces a more user friendly/open source approach to this project.
